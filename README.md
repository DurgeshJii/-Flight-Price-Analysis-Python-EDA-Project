# -Flight-Price-Analysis-Python-EDA-Project
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project performed on a 300K+ rows Flights Dataset using Python. This project is part of my Big Data Analysis learning journey.


📌 Project Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing flight prices using different factors such as:

Airline

Source & destination city

Departure & arrival times

Number of stops

Cabin class (Economy vs Business)

Days left before departure

The project includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, visual exploration, and insights generation.

🛠 Technologies & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📊 Key Analysis Performed
✔ Airline-wise frequency & average ticket price
✔ Time-of-day effect on flight pricing
✔ City-to-city price comparison
✔ Day-wise price changes (1–49 days before departure)
✔ Class-based (Economy vs Business) pricing difference
✔ Average price calculations for specific routes
📂 Files Included

Day_10_Project.py – cleaned Python script extracted from PDF

Dataset (CSV) – airlines_flights_data.csv

Visualizations – generated plots

🧠 Insights Gained

Business class prices are 8x higher than economy on average

Ticket prices rise sharply when booking 1–3 days before travel

Evening & night flights cost more than morning flights

Some routes show extremely high or low price outliers
